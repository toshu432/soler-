		<p style="font-size:20px;">Good morning everyone <br> Today we [ KUNAL SINGH , AASTIK CHAUHAN AND MUNKASHIF KHAN ] will explore a critical topic that lies at the intersection of technology, sustainability, and global efforts to combat climate change—solar energy.
		In this report, we will examine the global status of solar energy, its rapid growth, technological advancements and the pivotal role it plays in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. We will also discuss the challenges that remain in scaling solar power worldwide and the policies driving its adoption. Ultimately, we will see how solar energy is not only reshaping the energy landscape but also playing a vital role in the fight against climate change.</p>
		<h2 style="text-align:center;">WHAT IS SOLAR ENERGY :</h2>
		<p style="font-size:20px;">Solar energy is the energy we harness from the sun’s radiation. It is one of the most abundant and renewable energy sources available to us.</p>
		<h2 style="text-align:center;">HOW SOLAR ENERGY WORKS :</h2>
		<center><img style="height:400px;width:400px;margin:20px" src="3.jpeg">
		<img style="height:400px;width:400px;margin:20px" src="4.jpeg"></center>
		<p style="font-size:20px;">Solar energy is captured through technologies like solar photovoltaic (PV) panels and solar thermal systems. Here is a breakdown of the two main types:</p>
		<p style="font-size:20px;">1. Solar Photovoltaic (PV) Systems: These systems use solar panels made of semiconductor materials, typically silicon, to convert sunlight directly into electricity. When sunlight hits the panels, it excites electrons in the material, generating an electric current. This direct conversion from sunlight to electricity is what powers homes, businesses, and even large solar farms.</p>
		<p style="font-size:20px;">2. Solar Thermal Systems: Instead of converting sunlight directly into electricity, these systems use solar energy to heat a fluid. This heated fluid can either be used directly to heat buildings or can power turbines to generate electricity. Solar thermal technologies are often used in large-scale solar power plants, especially in regions with abundant sunlight.</p>
		<h2 style="text-align:center;">THE BENEFITS OF SOLAR ENERGY :</h2>
		<p style="font-size:20px;">:Renewable: Unlike fossil fuels, solar energy is endless. As long as the sun shines, we can harness its power.
		<br>:Clean: Solar energy produces no greenhouse gases, making it a vital tool in reducing the carbon footprint and combating climate change.
		<br>:Cost-Effective: Over the long term, solar energy systems reduce energy costs. Once installed, they require minimal maintenance and have long lifespans.
		<br>:Scalable: Solar panels can be installed on homes, commercial buildings, and even large solar farms, making it adaptable for various applications.

		<h2 style="text-align:center;">THE ROLE OF SOLAR ENERGY IN COMABTING CLIMATE CHANGE</h2>
		<p style="font-size:20px;">1. Reduces Greenhouse Gas Emissions:
		The primary cause of climate change is the release of greenhouse gases (GHGs), such as carbon dioxide (CO₂), into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas. These gases trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, leading to global warming and environmental disruption. Solar energy, on the other hand, produces electricity without emitting any GHGs, helping reduce the overall carbon footprint.
		For example, using solar energy to power homes or businesses instead of coal or gas plants can prevent the release of tons of CO₂ into the atmosphere annually.</p>
		<p style="font-size:20px;">2. Decreases Reliance on Fossil Fuels:
		The global energy system is heavily dependent on fossil fuels, which are finite, polluting, and a major contributor to climate change. Solar energy reduces our reliance on these harmful sources by providing a sustainable and inexhaustible energy supply from the sun.
		By shifting to solar power, countries can lower their dependence on fossil fuel imports and reduce the environmental damage associated with mining, drilling, and refining.</p>
		<p style="font-size:20px;">3. Prevents Air and Water Pollution:
		Fossil fuel combustion not only contributes to global warming but also pollutes the air with harmful chemicals like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, which lead to smog and acid rain. Solar energy generates electricity without producing these pollutants, improving air quality and public health.
		Additionally, solar energy doesn’t require water for power generation, unlike traditional fossil fuel or nuclear plants, which need vast amounts of water for cooling. This helps conserve water resources and prevents water pollution.</p>
		<p style="font-size:20px;">4. Promotes Decentralized Energy Production:
		Solar energy can be produced locally, either on rooftops or in communities, reducing the need for long-distance transmission of electricity. This decentralization reduces the energy losses that occur during transmission and supports energy resilience, especially in regions prone to extreme weather events, which are becoming more frequent due to climate change.</p>
		<p style="font-size:20px;">5. Encourages Sustainable Development:
		As the world transitions to renewable energy sources like solar, the overall environmental impact of energy production decreases. This shift supports more sustainable economic development models that prioritize long-term environmental health. Moreover, investing in solar energy infrastructure can drive green jobs and innovation, helping create a climate-resilient economy.</p>
		<p style="font-size:20px;">6. Enables Energy Storage and Grid Stability:
		While solar energy is intermittent (it only works when the sun is shining), advances in battery storage and smart grid technologies are enabling the storage of excess solar energy for use when needed. This helps smooth out fluctuations in renewable energy supply, reducing the need for backup power from polluting sources like coal and gas.</p>
		<p style="font-size:20px;">7. Supports Global Climate Goals:
		Solar energy is critical to meeting international climate commitments like the Paris Agreement, which aims to limit global warming to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels. By rapidly expanding solar capacity, nations can lower their carbon emissions and work towards achieving a more sustainable and climate-resilient energy future.</p>
